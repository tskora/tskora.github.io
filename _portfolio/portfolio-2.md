Principal investigator: **Prof. Piotr Petelenz**

We combine quantum chemistry computations of ground and excited states and time-dependent perturbation theory in order to model the intensity oscillations in ultrafast pump-probe spectroscopy. Those oscillations encode the information about the excited vibronic states.
