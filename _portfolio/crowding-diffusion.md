Principal investigator: **Dr. Svyatoslav Kondrat**

We harness Brownian dynamics simulations to reveal the generic effects of macromoleculesâ€™ properties, e.g., shape and activity, on the diffusion coefficients in cells.

One of my current aims is to develop a versatile software -- [``pyBrown``](https://tskora.github.io/pyBrown), for simulations of diffusion and reactions accounting for the hydrodynamic interactions. You can find the code [here](https://github.com/tskora/pyBrown), and its documentation [here](https://tskora.github.io/pyBrown).
