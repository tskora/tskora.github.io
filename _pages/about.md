My primary research interest is the diffusive motion of biologically relevant macromolecules (such as proteins and ribosomes) in crowded intracellular environments. In my research, I harness Brownian dynamics simulations to reveal the generic effects of macromolecules’ properties, e.g., shape and activity, on the diffusion coefficients in cells. One of my current aims is to develop a versatile software for simulations of diffusion and reactions accounting for the hydrodynamic interactions.
