I am an Assistant Professor at the Department of Complex Systems Modeling, Institute of Theoretical Physics, Faculty of Physics, University of Warsaw where I lead the [Cytoplasm Dynamics and Complexity Group](https://www.fuw.edu.pl/~tskora/).
Our primary research lies at the intersection of statistical physics and cell biology.
We investigate the fundamental laws governing the diffusive motion of essential cellular components -— such as proteins and ribosomes —- within the highly crowded environment of the biological cell.
To rigorously address this complex problem, we employ a multiscale modeling approach, spanning from all-atom Molecular Dynamics simulations through coarse-grained Brownian Dynamics up to lattice models and statistical mechanics
This work aims to explain breakdown of Stokes-Einstein law in concentrated protein and polymer solutions and to establish a methodology for predicting diffusivity under macromolecular crowding.

I completed my PhD at the Institute of the Physical Chemistry of the Polish Academy of Sciences, where my thesis, ["Diffusion and reactions under crowding: Theory and simulations"](https://ichf.edu.pl/files/BIP/202303DoktoratTomaszSylwesterSkora/main.pdf), was recognized with a [prize](https://www.cyfronet.pl/aktualnosci_i_wydarzenia/19888,3,komunikat,konkurs_na_prace_doktorska_-_edycja_2023_-_wyniki.html) by Academic Computer Centre CYFRONET AGH.
I then held a postdoctoral research associate position in [Bidone's lab](https://bidone.bme.utah.edu/) at the Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute, University of Utah

Our group’s current research is supported by the Polish Returns grant from the Polish National Agency for Academic Exchange (NAWA).
